## 1.
## There are many ways to make up a section. I prefer to create individual CTDs so 
## I can plot each and see if I trust the data. You have "station" in your data,
## so that provides an easy way to chop the data up with "split()". I'll call
## the results "asplit"
asplit <- split(a, a$station)

## 2.
## Now, let's create CTD objects, by running through the entries in this
## list called "asplit".
ctds <- vector("list", length(asplit))
for (i in seq_along(asplit)) {
    ctds[[i]] <- as.ctd(asplit[[i]], longitude=asplit[[i]]$longitude[1], latitude=asplit[[i]]$longitude[1])
}

## 3.
## Plot the profiles (always a good idea .. are the data sensible? I think 
## ctds[[2]] and ctds[[3]] have odd surface salinities but you will know
## your data better than I do.
for (i in seq_along(asplit)) {
    plot(ctds[[i]])
}

## 4.
## Assemble the CTDs into a section, summarize it, and plot a default-style plot.
sec <- as.section(ctds)
summary(sec)
plot(sec)

## 5.
## Plot just salinity
plot(sec, which="salinity")
