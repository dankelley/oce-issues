* `1219a.R`
- uses data in Kelley's possession.
- ask provider: was the compass working? (I'm seeing zeros only.)
- ISSUE: what is the range of admixture of data types? 
    - Arrays were ok for the old 'adp'.  Maybe we can set up an array for each
      type in a dataset, using indexing vectors keyed to time.
    - I think there is some limit of 16 types in a repeat, but is that true and
      will it always hold?
    - The trial dataset seems to have only one "version" for types 21 and 22.
      We could start with that, but should know whether others are popular.
