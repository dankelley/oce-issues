DK to CR: I've started a new directory system because I thought it might be
helpful generally to do so, rather than rely on cryptic directory names based
on issue numbers.  But I think it's important to have the R code in git, for
revision history etc., rather than on Dropbox.

If you disagree with this system, let me know -- probably email is simplest.

The present file will probably be altered a lot as (or if) we start using this
directory. For example, it might be broken down into working and failing tests,
timetables for change, action items, etc.
