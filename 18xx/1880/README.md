How to work here

1. Remove oce and reinstall from CRAN.
2. Edit 1880a.R, uncommenting the save() call and the stop() call just after it.
3. Type 'make' to create the 1880a_cran.rda file. (Note of the execution time.)
   Add this rda file to the repo.
4. Edit 1880a.R again, commenting out the save() and stop() calls.
