The `*.R` files are some tests done to try out ideas for labeling lines drawn
by `mapContour()`. There is no intention to reproduce the full features of the
basic R function `contour()`, but the hope is to provide at least crude
functionality.

If things seem promising, they may be incorporated into `R/map.R`, perhaps with
the detailed work being done in a C function, for speed.

The numbers in the filenames show the evolution of my tests.
