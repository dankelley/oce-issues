* 833a.R try to read each var; ok except for `HISTORY_` vars
* 833b.R translate Argo netcdf names to names in the oce convention
* 833c.R some interactive noodling around; the main result is 833d.R
* 833d.R looks promising; need more datafile tests before moving forward
* 833e.R as 833d.R but looks at all ~/Dropbox/oce-data/argo/*.nc files
