DK notes:
1. only need a few panels to see wobble.  Later I'll make
   the test be numeric.
2. I also think there's a problem with mapPlot() drawing a new
   screen.  What it does now, which only happens if bg=NA, is a 
   bug but it's nice because it shows the pole drift, so I will
   not bother with it until the wobble is removed.
