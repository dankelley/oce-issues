imagep(e[["echosounder"]]$echosounder)
```

Data file snippets:

# ad2cp_01.ad2cp
This is the first 50,000 bytes of a source file, constructed with
```
head -c 50000 ~/Dropbox/S101135A001_Ronald.ad2cp                     > ad2cp_01.ad2cp
```

# ad2cp_01.ad2cp

This is 50,000 bytes of a source file, after skipping enough that the window
will contain a known checksum error.

```
## Notice that we skip to char before the 0xa5
tail -c +166785283 ~/Dropbox/S101135A001_Ronald.ad2cp | head -c 50000 > ad2cp_02.ad2cp
od -x ad2cp_02.ad2cp | head -1 # is a5 there?
```
