The first part of the output of 1191a.R indicates that the only flag values are
1 and 4. The argo convention is that 1=good and 4=bad, and it is that
convention that is used in creating d1.

Predicted output from the summary() calls:

* d1: whatever it is
* d2: identical to d1 (FAILS. WHY?)
* d3: identical to d1
* d4: good data set to NA, bad data retained
