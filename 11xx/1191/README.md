This code will only work if you have a certain test file, and that file is not
in this git repo because it's private. That means that only the reporter and
the developers can do this test.

I want to let the code do the talking, so please look at the code and its
output. (Use "make" here to run the code and create a file named 1191a.out)

The first part of the output of 1191a.R indicates that the only flag values are
1 and 4. The argo convention is that 1=good and 4=bad, and it is that
convention that is used in creating d1.

Please read the code for an analysis of what is expected. It all seems ok to me
