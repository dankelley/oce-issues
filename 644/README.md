This directory will contain code, plus (PUBLIC DOMAIN) data files. The latter
should include .cnv and .rsk file, for this to be of much help in improving
oce.

IMPORTANT: as CR and DK put files here, they should add notes below. It makes
sense to use clean filenames, and to use an editor to trim down any data files
that are large in the github context (say larger than a few 10s of kbyte).

**01.cnv** the ctd.cnv file provided with the oce package. Ownership: DK.

**02.cnv** first 100 lines of file d2013-04-0001.cnv from the Beaufort Gyre
Exploration Program, downloaded in a zip file from
http://www.whoi.edu/beaufortgyre/data/LSSL_ctd2013.zip on 9 May 2015.
