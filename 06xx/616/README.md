* 616a.R bug-report code

* 616b.R demonstrate graphically the result of adding several fake polar
  points. (Not any help.)

* 616c.R see what xy points result from the fake poles. The printout shows that
  a lot are coming out infinite, and at essentially x=0.

* 616d.R tests external (system level) proj (vsn 4.8.0), to see what points can
  be mapped.  The graph is interesting and may prove useful.

* 616e.R shows that results match proj to within about 0.1 percent.

**NEXT** try d.R but within R, to check proj there. (The results of c seem hard
to explain)
