While working on https://github.com/dankelley/oce/issues/2078, I started to
wonder whether I was handling leap seconds correctly, given my (new)
realization that R sort of doesn't consider them.

# What R does

Here is a summary of what I have at
https://github.com/dankelley/oce/issues/2078#issue-1670080055.  First,

```{r}
tail(.leap.seconds, 2)
```

shows that 2015 had a leap second in mid-year.  So, I took the start of that
year and the start of the next, and tried to see whether the difference was an
integral number of days, using

```{r}
spd <- 86400 # seconds/day
remainder <- function(x) x - trunc(x)
A <- as.POSIXct("2015-01-01", tz="UTC")
B <- as.POSIXct("2016-01-01", tz="UTC")
remainder((as.numeric(B) - as.numeric(A))/spd)
```

This indicates that R "skips over" leap seconds.  I subsequently found some
hints of that at the help for `?POSIXt`, which has as follows (italics mine).

Unfortunately, the conversion is complicated by the operation of time zones and
leap seconds (according to this version of R's data, 27 days have been 86401
    seconds long so far, the last being on (actually, immediately before)
    2017-01-01: the times of the extra seconds are in the object
    .leap.seconds). The details of this are entrusted to the OS services where
possible. It seems that some rare systems used to use leap seconds, but all
known current platforms ignore them (as required by POSIX). This is detected
and corrected for at build time, *so "POSIXct" times used by R do not include
leap seconds on any platform.*

NOTE: this website is confusing, because it lets you specify the number of leap
seconds to use.  So, for test 2, I set that to 0, because it had been 18, a
value that seemed to have been leftover from test 1 (where it was correct). I
happen to know that there were no leap seconds in year 1981.  I have not
explored the website sufficiently to see why this odd leap-second pattern
exists (if it does -- if it's not just me being confused) because the following
tests are all I need for oce.

## Test 1

Expect (week=2243, second=18, rollover=0) to be 2023-01-01T00:00:00.  Or,
equivalently, expect (week=195, second=18, rollover=2) to be
2023-01-01T00:00:00.

First, verify that there were 18 leap seconds from 1980 (just prior to start of
the GPS program) to January 2023.

```{r}
.leap.seconds[.leap.seconds >= as.POSIXct("1980-01-01")]
```

Now, do the calculation and see if it matches the website.

```{r}
t <- as.POSIXct("2023-01-01 00:00:00", tz="UTC")
stopifnot(t == oce::numberAsPOSIXct(cbind(2243, 18, 0), "gps"))
stopifnot(t == oce::numberAsPOSIXct(cbind(195, 18, 2), "gps"))
```

## Test 2

Expect (week=51, second=345600, rollover=0) to be 1981-01-01T00:00:00.  Note
that 'Leapseconds' is set to zero on the webpage, which is 0 because there was
no leap second between 1980-01-06 (the start date for GPS tiems) and 1981-01-01.


```{r}
t <- as.POSIXct("1981-01-01 00:00:00", tz="UTC")
stopifnot(t == oce::numberAsPOSIXct(cbind(51, 345600, 0), "gps"))
```
