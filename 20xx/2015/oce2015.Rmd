title: Demo code for oce issue 2015 (download.bathy update)
---

The following code uses the "develop" github branch as of 2022-11-13.
Note that we now have resolutions under 1 arc-minute.  Oce, as marmap, selects
0.25 arc minutes if resolution is under 0.5, or 0.5 arc minutes if resolution
is under 1.

```{r fig.width=8}
library(oce)
for (res in c(0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2)) {
    f <- download.topo(-65, -63, 44, 45, res=res)
    t <- read.topo(f)
    plot(t, location="topleft")
    mtext(paste("dim=", paste(dim(t[["z"]]), collapse="x"), "with res=", res), line=0.25)
}
```
