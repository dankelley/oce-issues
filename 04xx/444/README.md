* ``444.R`` original posting

* ``444b.R`` with ``marginsAsImage`` (which I think makes more sense than
  ``444.R``)

* ``444c.R`` another approach to coding the test. Although this is a solution
  it may not be too relevant to the actual issue as originally stated.

* `444d.R` from CR: maybe the solution is just to do what R expects rather than try and code for every case? See [oce issues dicussion](https://github.com/dankelley/oce/issues/444#issuecomment-43249076)
