Also, please see https://github.com/dankelley/oce/issues/2289 for discussion.

* `44687` an XBT file being tested
* `2289a.R` first trial
* `2289b.R` second trial, reading more and displaying results more clearly
* `2289c.R` makes an assumption that the documentation is wrong in stating
  times are in YYMMDD, because if I instead assume YYYMMDD then I get the first
  date right. THIS NEEDS TO BE CHECKED!
* `2289d.R` makes an assumption that a blank for lon and lat 'X' fields means
  zero for decimal minutes. THIS NEEDS TO BE CHECKED!
* `2289e.R` start working towards oce code (makes multiple PNG files, sent to
  original requester privately for comment).
