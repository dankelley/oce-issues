Notation: UHL = ugly horizontal lines.

There are some old files in this directory that I've not documented in this
readme.  This whole directory is a sort of sandbox for me to test things.

## 388D.R

New tests, along similar lines to old tests.  **Summary** not terribly
promising, since results are sensitive to parameters.

## 388D.R

Try a new twist on the existing ideas: perturb longitude and see how much x
changes.  If it doesn't change much, the point is OK.  If it does change, it
may be near an edge.  The tests look pretty good to me, in the sense that red
dots appear by the UHL that appear for shifted prime merdian, and they even
occur for some other sots that are worth checking.
